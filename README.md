**Following are some of the important features of Python**:

1. **Python is open source**: The Python implementation is under an open source license that makes it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use.

2. **Python is interpreted**: Python is a high level language which is interpreted by a Python interpreter.

3. **Python is cross platform compatible**: Python can be executed on all major platforms like Windows, Linux/Unix, OS/2, Mac and others.

4. **Python is Object-Oriented**: In Python, we encapsulate data within the objects as it supports the object-oriented style of programming.

5. **Python is a great choice for new learners**: Python is easy to learn and follows a simple syntax, so it is a good choice for beginner programmers. Python also supports wide range of application development.

6. **Python is extensible**: Python has a wide range of libraries and built-in functions which helps in easy and rapid development of applications.

7. **Python is interactive**: Python users are provided a command prompt where they can interact directly with the interpreter to write programs.

8. **Database connectivity**: Python provides interfaces required to connect to all major databases like Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and others.

**Identifiers**:

In Python, variables, functions, classes, modules and objects are identified using a name known as an identifier. An identifier can start with an uppercase or lowercase character or an underscore (_) followed by any number of underscores, letters and digits. All identifiers in Python are case sensitive.

Example: weight=10

In the above example, weight is an identifier.
